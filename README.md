# Pig Game

This project was a step up form the guess my number project, here I had to think of the logic behind the game and how to accommodate the identification of what player was playing.

On this project I used JavaScript and practiced methods of hiding and showing pages as per users clicks, obtaining and using users input, and overall problem solving with logical thinking.

Dice Pig Game.

Player 1 starts rolling the dice and each dice roll will add its value to the current score, if the player rolls 1 it loosed all its current score and passed on the turn to player 2. To compute your current score to the total score the player has the option to clock on the hold button, this computes the score and passes the turn. The player to reach 100 points first wins.
